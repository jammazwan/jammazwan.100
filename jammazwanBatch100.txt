This project was left unfinished because I couldn't figure out, yet, how to utilized the NO_ROOT for reading the files. I made some progress but apparently there is some more stuff I still need to learn about. Until then I am marking all 4 projects with json to java as doNotTry this is not about learning camel it is about learning a specifice part of camel that would probably not be tested
